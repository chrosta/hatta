====================================
Using py2app with PyQt from MacPorts
====================================

The binary on the Hatta website is produced from a custom PyQt build that 
included only QtCore and QtGui. The PyQt bundle from MacPorts compiles all 
the modules (wisely), but that makes PyQt python module require all the Qt 
modules (like QtNetwork or QtDBus --- obviousely not needed by mac version 
of Hatta). That in turn produces a 100MB bundle, which is an overkill.

So to compile your own bundle with py2app, build a custom PyQt with only 
QtGui and QtCore and when using py2app add the custom PyQt modules path to 
PYTHONPATH environmental variable before your default system PyQt (for 
example the one in MacPorts).

If size isn't an issue for you or you jsut don't want to play with custom 
builds, **add PyQt4._qt to the includes dictionary for py2app in 
setup.py**.
