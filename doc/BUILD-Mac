====================================
Using py2app with PyQt from MacPorts
====================================

The binary on the Hatta website is produced from a custom PyQt build that 
included only QtCore and QtGui. The PyQt bundle from MacPorts compiles all 
the modules (wisely), but that makes PyQt python module require all the Qt 
modules (like QtNetwork or QtDBus --- obviously not needed by mac version 
of Hatta). That in turn produces a 100MB bundle, which is an overkill.

So to compile your own bundle with py2app, build a custom PyQt with only 
QtGui and QtCore and when using py2app add the custom PyQt modules path to 
PYTHONPATH environmental variable before your default system PyQt (for 
example the one in MacPorts).

If size isn't an issue for you or you just don't want to play with custom 
builds, **add PyQt4._qt to the includes dictionary for py2app in 
setup.py**.

Removing debugging libraries
============================

Since py2app adds also the _debug version of libraries (QtCore_debug and 
QtGui_debug) you can strip a few additional MB of the final bundle by 
deleting them, since no one will be using them for the most part. You 
could do something like this after running py2app:

::

  $ find dist | grep debug | xargs rm -f
